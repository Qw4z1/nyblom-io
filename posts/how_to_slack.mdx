## Intro

As covid hit and people who where used to work in an office had to start working remotely, Slack (and similar tools) became the defacto standard for communication. A "ping" became the new knock on a shoulder and people became frustrated when a reply delayed. All of this lead to availability stress followed by burnout. However, I feel that my team and I have come up with a good set of rules to combat this.

## Best practices

### [Don't just say hello](https://nohello.net/)

  * Slack is asynchronous by nature, which means you can never expect an instant response.

  * Prefer being responsive over being reactive

  * Prefer one long message over many short ones, to reduce the number of notifications the receiver gets.

  * Make sure the point you want to get across is in the first message you send. This significantly reduces lead time.

  * Sum up your thoughts in a longer message instead of asking to hop on a call.

    * Calls are useful for complex questions, but most questions are not complex.

  *  Writing longer messages helps you think by forcing you to structure your thoughts.

### Explicit > implicit

* Don't use abbreviations

  * They can be ambiguous and lead to miss-understandings

  * They are confusing to new team members who don't have the full context.

* When writing a question or comment prefer giving the full context

* Think about including enough information so that the reader doesn't have to leave the text to get the full picture
  
  * When writing something in relation to a ticket (we use Favro, but also applies to Jira, Trello, Basecamp etc), include some context on the ticket itself

  * Just linking to the ticket requires the reader to context switch between Slack and Favro.

* This includes Standup messages

  * Yes, written standups are great.

### Slack is transient

* Even if we organise in channels, all information eventually gets lost.

  * Search is powerful, but only if you know what you are looking for

  * As soon as a decision has been made regarding a feature, an epic or a bug, this information needs to be copied over to the respective card in Favro.


### Reply in thread

* Threads is how you keep organized, even with multiple conversations going on in the same channel.

  * Use the message in channel as the topic for the conversation.

    * First message in the thread should give the full context (be explicit)

  * Only people in the thread will get notified by messages in the thread
  
    * This means less risk to disturb your co-workers

      * Makes notifications useful again

### Reacting to a message is a good signal that something is read. 

  * A thumbs up, ok hand or rocket, lets the author know that you have seen it and will take appropriate action. 

  * Sometimes there needs to be more context and the conversation continues, but sometimes a simple thumbs up is enough.

  * Prefer adding reacting one time too much rather that reacting one time too little.

  * Emojis make people smile. üòÉ

### Prefer to keep most of the communication in public channels, rather than private messages. 

  * Keep a **public by default** mindset

* Oversharing of information is encouraged

  * You never know who might find the information useful

  * You never know who might have good input on the things you share

* Use #random for anything that is not work related.

### It's ok to turn off notifications

* Don't expect instant or even quick replies

* Muting channels that are less urgent to you is perfectly fine, and might even be required

  * Ignoring notifications for a channel is not the same as ignoring the content in the channel. It just means you take responsibility to update yourself on your own time.

### Use status updates

* Even with asynchronous work, it can be nice to know what team members are doing right now. 

  * Statuses are great for this

* Examples of when it can be used includes

  * üçö when on your lunch brake

  * ü¶∑ when at the dentist

  * üèãüèª when at the gym

  * ‚úàÔ∏è when traveling

* Leverage auto clearing of statuses by setting an appropriate time

* Use a Calendar integration to automatically get a status set when in meetings
