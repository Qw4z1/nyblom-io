There is a certain type of meeting that makes me deflate completely and let out a grunt that sounds something like [Lurch in the Adams Family](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-oqgIZGhbU). 

You know which meeting I’m talking about. It’s the one that you said yes to two months ago that you though would probably be ok, but now that you are there you know it’s just going to be draining and a waste of your time. Uuurrghhhh…

Not to long ago I realized that my calendar was full of those meetings. I had to hit pause and regroup. 

This coincided with a session I had with my amazing coach, Alyssa, and when I told her about this she responded with a question. If this is not it, how do I want my life to feel. Without missing a beat I responded with a single word: 

Effortless.

An important note here is that effortless does not mean free from problems that I have to solve. It also doesn’t mean free from challanges that I need to overcome. 

What it means is that everything I do is a concious choice or a consequence thereof. Where the problems I face are tied to a goal or a lifestyle that I’m committed to. Where I can have space in my calendar to work on challenges that will make me grow.

The very next day I cancelled bunch of my meetings with a brutally honest “I’m sorry. My priorities have changed and I no longer think it would be a meaningful use of my time.” 

And just like that I am now free to persue the projects that give me energy.

Such as writing this blog post.

What is one thing you can do to live a more effortless life?
