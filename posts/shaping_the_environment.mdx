Most founders don’t spend much time thinking about management systems. Most feel they are too busy doing sales, recruiting, marketing… You know, actual work.

But I would argue that the work gets easier and more rewarding by spending a little bit of time thinking about how your management systems influence both culture and results.

## The Devies Experience

To show you how, let me share a quick story from my own experience. When I started Devies together with my two cofounders, we knew that creating a strong sense of belonging would be a priority for us. Average employee retention in consulting companies was terrible at the time. By increasing retention we could save on both time and money when it came to recruiting.

What we came up with was something unintuitive. One day a week, our consultants worked from our office instead of onsite with clients. The goal was for them to not work on billable projects. Instead focusing on projects to gain new skills. In other words, we gave up 20% of billable hours to bet on our employees.

This might seem like madness when the whole business model is built on billable hours. But not only did the one day a week foster a sense of belonging. It also became a USP when hiring. It gave our employees opportunities to try new types of client engagements. It enabled us to increase our rates, which in turn informed which clients we chose to work with. And much more.f

## From policy to culture

I didn’t call it a management system at the time. But that is what it was. Looking back it’s obvious that it aligned us and silently shaped our culture. And, perhaps more importantly, it gave everyone more clarity. Our “80/20” policy made it crystal clear to everyone what we valued and how we operated. It wasn’t just a policy; it was a statement about who we were as a company.

When systems are clear, employees understand what’s expected and why it matters. They can connect their daily work to larger goals. They can act independently. This clarity creates an environment where employees can thrive.

# One size does not fit all

But clarity isn’t enough. You also need to align your systems with your strategy.

If your strategy depends on high developer retention, as it did for us, your systems might focus on extensive onboarding, regular feedback sessions, and clear career progression paths. You might also invest in coaches that help bring out the best in your developers, and you measure employee satisfaction and retention.

However, if your strategy depends on a high-performing sales team, your approach should probably be different. Maybe you build a system based on progressive compensation structures that makes your employees get higher bonuses the more they sell. You might also want to churn 30% to only keep top performers.

Same function - hiring and managing staff - but very different systems. The key is alignment with your specific goals.

## Wrapping it up

Remember how we started this conversation? Most founders think they’re too busy for management systems. But now you can see that these systems aren’t just admin work - they’re the invisible force shaping your company’s future.

Your management systems are quietly at work every day, influencing how your team operates, how they feel about their work, and ultimately, how well your strategy succeeds. They’re the difference between a team that’s aligned and thriving, and one that’s confused and underperforming.

So, here’s your challenge: take a hard look at your current systems. Are they intentionally designed to support your goals? Or have they just evolved haphazardly? Spend some time this week identifying one area where a thoughtful system could make a big difference. Maybe it’s in how you onboard new hires, how you set and communicate goals, or how you reward performance.

Start small. You don’t need to change everything overnight. Focus on being clear about what you’re trying to achieve, and be ready to adapt as you learn. Your future self - and your team - will thank you for laying this foundation early. After all, as a leader, you’re not just doing the work - you’re creating the environment where great work happens.
