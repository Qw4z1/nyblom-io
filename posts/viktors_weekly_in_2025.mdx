2024 is about to end and as always I have earmarked a good chunk of time to reflect on everything I’ve been up to over the year. One of those things is this newsletter.

It’s become one of my favorite things, and for 2025 I want to make it even better. To do that I’ve come up with three promises/goals for Viktor’s Weekly.

## 1. Follow the Law of 100s

I’ve managed to send out this newsletter every Friday for 19 weeks straight. I promise to continue my streak and send it every week for all of 2025. The ultimate goal is to make it to 100 to conform to the Law of 100s.

If you don't know what the Law of 100s is, the story goes something like this. A fledgling YouTuber goes up to Mr Beast at a conference and asks him what he needs to do to become a successful YouTuber.

“Easy”, says Mr Beast. “Go home and publish 100 videos on your channel and improve one thing with every video. When you’ve done that come back and ask me again.”

But the fledgling never returns. By producing 100 videos, improving one small detail every time, the fledgling has learned everything he needed to learn to become a successful YouTuber.

This is how I think about my newsletter. By committing to publishing once a week, every week, for 100 weeks I make sure I follow the Law of 100s and learn how to write a great newsletter.

## 2. Make people want to share my writing

Seth Godin says that to create something remarkable I need to create something that people want to remark on. In my world, people remark on things by sharing them. Either on social media or by simply forwarding the email.

My goal for 2025 is to have each edition so interesting that it is shared at least once. This is my North Star metric for Viktor’s Weekly. I chose this over subscriber counts and other metrics, because my reasons for writing this newsletter are all tied to my own self-improvement.

Those weeks where I’ve focused on increasing subscriber count I’ve spent more time and energy on social media instead of trying to just write a better newsletter. Since I don’t have any ambition to monetize this newsletter growth isn’t that important. Which brings me to the third and final resolution.

## 3. Keep the newsletter free

As we’ve already established, making money is not my goal with this newsletter (not right now, anyway). So charging for it doesn’t make sense. What it would do is gear me towards tactics for chasing subscribers. “Show me the incentives, and I’ll show you the outcome”, as the great Charlie Munger once said.

Keeping it free means I can stay free in my writing. I can take risks and write in a new style every once in a while, or write about a topic that doesn’t strictly fit the mold. I am more likely to stay true to myself and write about topics that interest me.

But what about sponsors? When I started this newsletter I got two amazing entrepreneurs to sponsor the 10 first editions (thank you [Heijbel Growth](https://heijbelgrowth.com/) and [HiCareer](https://hicareer.com/)!). This was not about making money, but rather to keep me accountable through the period where I was the most likely to quit.

If I decide to monetise this newsletter I will probably consider sponsors before subscribers. But that’s a big IF.

## Wrap up

Looking forward to continuing our journey together in 2025!
