# Nyblom as a Service

_Subscribe to me as your strategic technology partner_

It can be difficult for early-stage startups to find a CTO. The recruitment process can be both expensive and time-consuming. And if you get it wrong, you risk the future of the company.

Fortunately, many early-stage startups don't need a full-time CTO. They need developers and someone that they can call when they need a second opinion from someone who has been through it all multiple times before.

They need a fractional CTO. This is where I come in! I advise founders, coach technical leaders, and build teams on a part-time basis.

I've worked in the tech industry for over a decade now. Most of that time as a leader, and almost exclusively in the context of mobile apps. 

I've coached technical leaders as well as non-technical founders, I've recruited countless developers, and I have repeatedly built successful product and engineering organizations.

## FAQ

### What is a Fractional CTO?

A Fractional CTO (fCTO) is someone who works part-time, often for a limited time. They are usually experienced CTOs, who can contribute in more ways than just code. For example, they can work as an advisor to a company board, manage a development department, or as a coach and mentor for a full-time CTO who has less experience in the role. It all depends on the needs of the client and the expertise of the fCTO.
