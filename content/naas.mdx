# Nyblom as a Service

_Subscribe to me as your strategic technology partner_

It can be difficult for early-stage startups to find a CTO. The recruitment process can be both expensive and time-consuming. And if you get it wrong, you risk the future of the company.

Fortunately, many early-stage startups don't need a full-time CTO. They need developers and someone that they can call when they need a second opinion from someone who has been through it all multiple times before.

This is where I come in! 

I've worked with technical leaders and non-technical founders. I've recruited countless developers. I've repeatedly built successful product and engineering organizations. And I've launched countless products.

Now I do it on a part-time basis so that I can help as many people as possible.
