# Nyblom as a Service

<br/>

Now I help founders and leaders in tech to manage their product development to get to scale faster.

Over the past decade, I've repeatedly built successful product and engineering organizations, launched countless products, helped raise millions in funding, and advised both technical and non-technical founders.

Think of me as a technical leadership coach, who can help you win more, faster. You will still have to put in the work, but I'll make sure you get the most out of every hour you put in.

Does this sound interesting?
