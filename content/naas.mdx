# Nyblom as a Service

_Hire me as your Fractional CTO and strategic technology partner_

It can be difficult for early stage startups to find a CTO. It's expensive. The recruitement process takes a long time. And just where the heck do you find a CTO, anyway?

Fortunately, manuy early stage startups don't need a full time CTO. They need developers and someone that they can call when they need a second opinion from someone that has been through it all multiple times before.

They need a fractional CTO. This is where I come in! I advice founders, coach techical leaders and build teams on a part time basis.

I've worked in the tech industry for over a decade now. Most of that time as a leader, and almost exclusively in the context of mobile apps. 

I've coached technical leaders as well as non-technical founders, I've recruited countless developers, and I have repeatedly build successful product and engineering organisations.

## FAQ

### What is a Fractional CTO?

A Fractional CTO (fCTO) is someone who works part time, often for a limited time period. They are usually experienced CTOs, who can contribute in more ways than just code. For example, they can work as an advisor to a company board, manage a development department or as a coach and mentor for a fulltime CTO that has less experience in the role. It all depends on the needs of the client and the expertise of the fCTO.

### What can you help me with?

The short answer is _"A lot"_, but here is a non-exhaustive list to give you an idea:

- Non-technical support providing the right information to CEOs, management teams and boards.
- Translating business requirements into engineering problems
- Work with existing team establish a scalable product development process
- Roadmap review and input
- Hiring the right developers based on your business' constraints
