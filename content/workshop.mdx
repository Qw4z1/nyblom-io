# Workshops

<br/>

If you want more than 1-on-1 coaching, I also offer several types of workshops. These workshops can be done with leaders or with the whole team, depending on the stage of the company and the size of the team.

<br/>

## Strategy Workshop

* Redefine your technical roadmap
* Align business goals with technology vision
* Set up an optimal team structure for your stage
* Crete KPIs to measure performance

## Deep Work Systems

Some tech organisations get nothing done because they are busy answering Slack messages and wasting time in meetings. This workshop is aimed at setting boundaries and creating fraworks for communication, so that teams get enough space for deep work.

* Design sustainable deep work systems
* Create effective escalation protocols
* Build team habits that protect both focus and collaboration
* Set up communication frameworks that reduce noise while maintaining alignment

## Leadership Alignment Workshop

The CEO-CTO relationship is arguably the most important relationship in the company. This three hour workshop is aimed at aligning the CEO and CTO by deepening that relationship.

This workshop is great for CTOs who recently transitioned into their role.
