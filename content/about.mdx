# I'm Viktor  
<br/>
## I like building and teaching

My blessing and curse is that I do a lot of things

Over the past decade I've built <Link href="https://doktor.se">apps</Link>, <Link href="https://babyjourney.se">teams</Link>, and companies <Link href="https://www.devies.se">companies</Link>. 

I've also built a <Link href="https://affirmado.com">bunch</Link> <Link href="https://www.pomokitten.app">of</Link> <Link href="https://dailystoicwisdom.app">things</Link> that didn't go anywhere.

<Link href="/now">Currently</Link> I'm building a new life for myself together with my girlfriend.

I believe in <Link href="/newsletter">sharing</Link> what I learn and think with anyone who is interested. For a long time, I thought I would become a teacher. I think I've finally become one.

If you prefer listening, you're in luck! I've been fortunate enough to have been a guest in a number of podcasts:

* [Time to Live: Why Technical Skills Aren't Enough Anymore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vnJlVbhYgM)

* [Favro Podcast: Tech Investing in Times of Uncertainty.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsX2CuzrD2A)

* [Techrekpodden (in Swedish):  VÃ¤gen till CTO & kampen med att gÃ¥ in i vÃ¤ggen](https://techrekpodden.libsyn.com/172-vgen-till-cto-kampen-att-g-in-i-vggen)

I regularly enjoy <Link href="/cto-coaching">coaching CTOs</Link> on the really gnarly problems they might run into when running a tech org in a startup. Building systems for deep work and making the mental shift from individual contributor to strategic executive.

The past 5 years I've also invested way too much money into <Link href="/portfolio">early stage startups</Link>. Have I made any money back yet? Nope! 20% of them don't exist anymore. Two are looking really good. Ask me again in five years. ðŸ˜‰

## I also like single-player mode

People I've met are often surprised to hear that I am an introvert. When meeting people I can be engaged and high energy for a couple of hours. And then I need to go home and rest.

I also play a lot of video games. By myself. No MMOs for me! Single player RPGs and strategy is what I like. I've completed 100% of all achivements in Fallout 4 and spent more hours playing Civilization 6 than any other game.

I also love my journaling routine. Every morning I light a candle in my skullshaped candleholder (memento mori), uncap one of my many fountain pens and just start writing.

I've always enjoyed reading. The past years I've started ranking the non-fiction books I read. I keep a list of the books I've ranked highest under <Link href="/books">/books</Link>.

## Some of the things I've done

- CTO at a successful [baby tech app startup](https://babyjourney.se)
