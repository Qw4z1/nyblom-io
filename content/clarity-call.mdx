# Book a Clarity Call

One of my superpowers is to simplify the complex. In the Clarity Calls, I use this superpower to help you work through your most difficult problems with actionable insight as the end goal.

Examples of problems that I've helped people with in the past:
 * Product positioning: What are you building and who are you building it for?
 * Tech Stack Strategy: Is your tech stack scalable enough for what you want to achieve?
 * Tech Team Strategy: Get clear on what roles you need and who you need to hire now!
 * Fundraising Strategy: What do you need to do to get ready to start raising money?
 * In-house Development Transition: How do you go from outsourced development to in-house?
