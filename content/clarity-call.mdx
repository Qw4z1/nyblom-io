# Book a Clarity Call

Turning complexity into something simple is my superpower.

In our 90 minute session, I use this superpower to help you work through your most difficult problems with actionable insight as the end goal.

Examples of problems that I've helped people with in the past:
 * Company Strategy: How can you make sure you play to your strengths?
 * Product positioning: What are you building and who are you building it for?
 * Tech Stack Strategy: Is your tech stack scalable enough for what you want to achieve?
 * Team Strategy: Get clear on what roles you need and who you need to hire now!
 * Founder conflict: How should you act when your cofounders and you want different things?
 * Delegating Effectively: Do you need help creating a system to play to your strengths and delegate the rest?
