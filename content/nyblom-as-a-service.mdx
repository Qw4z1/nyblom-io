# Nyblom as a Service

<br />

I've spent over a decade building apps, teams, and companies.

Drawing from my broad experience of different contexts, and applying industry best practices, I now coach founders (technical or non-technical) and CTOs on how to build the right thing the right way, and make more money while doing it.

I do this in two ways:

## On-demand Clarity Calls

One of my superpowers is to simplify the complex. In the Clarity Calls, I use this superpower to help you work through your most difficult problems with actionable insight as the end goal.

Examples of problems that I've helped people with in the past:
 * Product positioning: What are you building and who are you building it for?
 * Tech Stack Strategy: Is your tech stack scalable enough for what you want to achieve?
 * Tech Team Strategy: Get clear on what roles you need and who you need to hire now!
 * Fundraising Strategy: What do you need to do to get ready to start raising money?
 * In-house Development Transition: How do you go from outsourced development to in-house?

## Monthly retainer 

Taking on a mixed role of advisor and coach I join your team in getting clear and focused in your day to day work.

Communication happens through weekly calls with async communication (Slack, email, Loom) in between where we work together on product and strategy. 

Common problems are product roadmaps, technology choices, making non-technical founders understand developers, and getting investment ready.
