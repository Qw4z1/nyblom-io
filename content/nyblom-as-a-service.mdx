# Nyblom as a Service

*I coach CTOs who want to go from Good to Great.*

A decade of building apps, teams, and companies has taught me one thing: clarity is the catalyst for success. 

With my background as a CTO I've seen how easy it is for product and tech teams to lose track of who they are building for and why they are building the product they are building.

**I help CTOs to:**

1. Clarify your Vision for Your Role
2. Transform Vision into immediate action
3. Align your actions with a focused strategy
4. Get more done without burning out

<br />

## My Approach

I coach around three core pilars: Energy, Excellence and Executive Mindset.

Energy is about learning to managing how you spend your time and how you approach what you can and cannot control. This area goes deep and will be both personal and uncomfortable.

Excellence is about the craft. Mastering all the tools that a Great CTO needs to turn the tech organisation into the engine that drives the whole company.

Executing Mindset is where you learn to go from the person who delivers the code to the person who delivers the Vision. This includes deepening the relationship with your CEO and the rest of the C-suite.
