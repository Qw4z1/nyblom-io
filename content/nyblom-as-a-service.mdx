# Nyblom as a Service

*I coach CTOs who want to go from Good to Great.*

A decade of building apps, teams, and companies has taught me one thing: clarity is the catalyst for success. 

With my background as a CTO I've seen how easy it is for product and tech teams to lose track of who they are building for and why they are building the product they are building.

**I help CTOs to:**

1. Clarify your Vision for Your Role
2. Transform Vision into immediate action
3. Align your actions with a focused strategy
4. Get more done without burning out

<br />

## My Approach

I coach around three core pilars: Energy, Excellence and Executive Mindset.

**Energy Management:** Master your time and focus on what truly matters, without burning out

**Technical Excellence:** Transform your tech organization into the engine that drives company growth 

**Executive Mindset:** Evolve from code delivery to vision delivery, deepening C-suite relationship
