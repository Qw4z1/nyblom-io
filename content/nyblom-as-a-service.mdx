### Turning startup CTOs into effective executives

<br />

Are you a technical founder or CTO who is:

* Overwhelmed by day-to-day operations, leaving no time for strategic work?
* Struggling to build and scale your engineering team?
* Finding it challenging to contribute at the executive level?
<br />
 I help startup CTOs transform from hands-on developers into *effective tech executives* through working on three core pillars:

* Energy Management: Master your time and focus on what truly matters, without burning out

* Technical Excellence: Transform your tech organization into the engine that drives company growth 

* Executive Mindset: Evolve from code delivery to vision delivery, deepening C-suite relationships

<br />
With a decade of engineering leadership and a successful exit, I've walked the path from developer to tech executive. My coaching isn’t just about solving today’s problems. It’s about equipping you for long-term success.
