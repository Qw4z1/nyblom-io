# Nyblom as a Service

<br />

I've spent over a decade building apps, teams, and companies.

I now help founders get clarity in thought so they can turn that clarity into action.

Together we will develop a product strategy, work with the dev team to implement the strategy, and work on the company so that everyone is aligned with the strategy.

## How I do it

I will work with you and select team members to:

- Help you focus your roadmap to reach your goals faster
- Build a bridge between business and tech that will remain even when I'm gone
- Cut development cycle from 6 weeks to 6 days
- Coach you towards becoming a better tech CEO
- Chair your advisory board, to make sure you get the most out all members
- Level up your current CTO through 1on1 coaching
- Strategy creation and implementation

If any of these examples resonate with you, or if you have another problem that you think I might be able to help you with, please use the link below to schedule a discovery call with me free of charge!
