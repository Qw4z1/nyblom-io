# Nyblom as a Service

<br />

I've spent over a decade building apps, teams, and companies.

Drawing from my broad experience of different contexts, and applying industry best practices, I now coach founders (technical or non-technical) and CTOs on how to build the right thing the right way.

I do this in two ways:

On-demand Clarity Calls. One of my superpowers is to simplify the complex. In the Clarity Calls, I use this superpower to help you work through your most difficult problems with actionable insight as the end goal. Common problems are ...

Monthly retainer. Communication happens through weekly calls with async communication (Slack, email, Loom) in between where we work together on product and strategy. Common problems are product roadmaps, technology choices, making non-technical founders understand developers, and getting investment ready.

Does this sound interesting?
