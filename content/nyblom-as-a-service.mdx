# Nyblom as a Service

<br />

I've spent over a decade building apps, teams, and companies.

I've successfully built product and engineering organizations, launched countless products, and I've helped raise millions in funding.

I've also made lots of mistakes.

Now I coach and advise founders and leaders in tech on how to build the right thing sooner. By drawing from my broad experience of different contexts, and applying industry best practices, I can help you avoid the mistakes I've made.

I do this through bi-weekly 1on1 calls with async communication (Slack, email, Loom), where we work together on the problem that is currently giving you the greatest headache.

Think of me as a technical leadership coach, who can help you win more, faster. You will still have to put in the work, but I'll be there with you every step of the way.

Does this sound interesting?
