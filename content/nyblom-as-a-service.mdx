# Nyblom as a Service

*I coach CTOs who want to go from Good to Great.*

A decade of building apps, teams, and companies has taught me one thing: clarity is the catalyst for success. 

With my background as a CTO I've seen how easy it is for product and tech teams to lose track of who they are building for and why they are building the product they are building.

<br />

## My Approach

Every CTO’s journey is unique, which is why my coaching is deeply personalized. Through one-on-one sessions, we’ll collaborate to craft a roadmap tailored to your needs, using the following three core pillars, Energy, Excellence and Executive Mindset, as a starting point.

Here is how it could look:

### From Burnout to Balanced Leadership

You'll transition from being constantly overwhelmed to finding your rhythm as a leader. Previous clients have discovered how to prioritize their wellbeing alongside their company's growth - integrating healthy habits that make them more effective leaders. This holistic approach helps you perform at your best while building a sustainable leadership practice.

### From Daily Firefighting to Strategic Vision

Through our partnership, you'll move beyond the day-to-day technical challenges to embrace your role as a visionary leader. I've guided technical leaders through critical transitions - from considering closing their business to building ambitious innovation centers, from struggling with co-founder dynamics to confidently leading their company's next chapter. You'll gain the clarity and confidence to think bigger!

### From Individual Contributor to Scalable Leadership

Together, we'll create the systems and structures that allow you to scale your impact. My clients develop practical tools like career progression frameworks, time allocation systems, and team management strategies. You'll build a foundation that supports both your growth as a leader and your organization's expansion.

My coaching isn’t just about solving today’s problems—it’s about equipping you for long-term success.If this sounds valuable to to, use the link below to book a discovery call to start leveling up!

## Who is it for?

In short, CTO coaching is an inner journey aimed at accelerating your growth. 

It focuses on the unique challenges and opportunities faced by those leading technology teams, products, and strategies within organizations, and is tailored to your specific situation. 

CTO coaching is benifitial for current and aspiring CTOs who want to:

* Define your purpose as a CTO and align your leadership with the company’s mission and goals.
