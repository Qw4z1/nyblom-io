# Nyblom as a Service

<br />

I've spent over a decade building apps, teams, and companies.

I now help founders (technical or non-technical) do the same by drawing from my broad experience of different industries.

In, a nutshell, I work with founders develop a product strategy, work with the dev team to implement the strategy, and work on the company so that everyone is aligned with that strategy. 

### What are some more examples of what you can help with?

A non-exhaustive list:

- Help you focus on building the right thing at the right time
- Guide you in establishing a scalable product development process
- Chair your advisory board, to make sure you get the most out of it
- Level up your current CTO through 1on1 coaching
- Guide you in Roadmaping review and input to help you get to product market fit
- Support in building a recruitment roadmap (what's the next role to hire)
- Support CEOs, management teams, and boards in making strategic, technical decisions.

If any of these examples resonate with you, or if you have another problem that you think I might be able to help you with, please use the link below to schedule a discovery call with me free of charge!
