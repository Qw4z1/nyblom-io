## Life

I've been back in Stockholm, Sweden since January 2024. My life now revolves around building mobile apps with my girlfriend, <Link href="/nyblom-as-a-service/">coaching founders and leaders</Link>, and taking care of two foster cats.

However, I've been sleepwalking too much. Doing comfortable things instead of awesome things. The rest of the year will be dedicated to being exceptional.
<br/>
## Health and fitness

Forget about weight loss. I don't care about abs. I want to be strong. I want to look powerful.

My strength goal for 2024 is to lift 300 kg in squats, bench and deadlifts combined. currently at 250 kg.
<br/>
## Tech

My primary focus is currently [Kotlin Multiplatform Compose](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/). Every mobile app I build is built with KMP and Compose. 

I've also experimented a bit with [building a backend](https://github.com/Qw4z1/read-tracker) using Ktor and Kotlin. If I get the motivation I'll combine this backend with my companion mobile app to share models and business logic between iOS, Android, and Backend.

Oh, and did I mention that I ❤️ Kotlin?

- [Secret project]()

For my last two projects, I've been using Firebase. Firebase is great for a lot of things, but for my next project, I'm going all in on Kotlin. This means a Kotlin Multiplatform project with Android, iOS, and server (Ktor again) sharing code.

Everything will be hosted on Digital Ocean. If you are looking for a new provider for your apps, feel free to use my [referral link](https://m.do.co/c/52c509c9280e) to save us both some money. You get $200 in credits and I get $25. Pretty sweet, right?
