This is a Now Page. If you don't know what a [Now Page](https://nownownow.com/about) is and you have a personal website, I think you should have one too.

## Life

I've been back in Stockholm, Sweden since January 2024. My life now revolves around building mobile apps with my girlfriend, <Link href="/cto-coaching">coaching CTOs</Link>, and taking care of two foster cats.

I feel like 2025 has had a rocket launch of a start and I am looking forward to a year of building the life of my dreams.
<br/>
## Health and fitness

~~Forget about weight loss. I don't care about abs. I want to be strong. I want to look powerful.~~ Nope! I'm fat. I am in a caloric deficit until easter, hoping to lose 6-8 kg of fat. 

My strength goal for 2025 is to lift 300 kg in squats, bench and deadlifts combined, and to be able to do 10 pullups. That would have been very easy if it hadn't been for a herniated disc. =/ Haven't been able to squat heavy since before Christmas. 
<br/>
## Tech

My primary technology focus is [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) and [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform/). 

I think Jetbrains really knocked it out of the park with this one. Every mobile app I build is therefore built with KMP and Compose. Every backend I build is built with Kotlin and Ktor (and/or Firebase).

Oh, and did I mention that I ❤️ Kotlin?
