## Life

I've been back in Stockholm, Sweden since January 2024. My life now revolves around building mobile apps with my girlfriend, <Link href="/nyblom-as-a-service/">coaching founders and leaders</Link>, and taking care of two foster cats.

Life is good!

Last year I published 12 blog posts, which was exactly half of my goal for the year. In 2024 I plan to publish another 12. One per month is a good pace for me to manage to maintain quality.

## Health and fitness

I am currently in a weight loss phase. The goal is to drop to sub 90 kg and then just maintain my strength through the summer.

My strength goal for 2024 is to lift 300 kg in squats, bench and deadlifts combined. currently at 250 kg.

## Tech

My primary focus is currently [Kotlin Multiplatform Compose](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/). Every mobile app I build is built with KMP and Compose. 

I've also experimented a bit with [building a backend](https://github.com/Qw4z1/read-tracker) using Ktor and Kotlin. If I get the motivation I'll combine this backend with my companion mobile app to share models and business logic between iOS, Android, and Backend.

For my current project, though, I'm using Firebase. I just think Firebase gives the best bang for the buck when building mobile apps. Even compared to direct competitors, such as Supabase. This is because the client SDKs for Firebase are just so damn good.

Oh, and did I mention that I ❤️ Kotlin?
