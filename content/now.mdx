This is a Now Page. If you don't know what a [Now Page](https://nownownow.com/about) is and you have your own website, I think you should one too.

## Life
I've been living in Stockholm since 2017 and, more specifically, SÃ¶dermalm since 2019. I've been living in startup land since 2012. Either working for startups, building startups or investing in startups. Usually all three at once.

## Health and fitness

During December I gave myself permission to really let myself go. I properly gave in to my cravings and ate every tasty thing that came into my way. The only rule here was that after the Christmas weekend I promised myself to go on a fairly strict training program.

My current strength training routine consist of the classic [Starting Strength program](https://startingstrength.com/get-started/programs). My goal it to be able to squat 80 kg(3x5) paired with a body weight of 87 kg by the end of the year.

## Tech

Currently CTO at a startup called [Baby Journey](https://babyjourney.se/). Our vision is to become a universe for life with small children. This vision leaves a lot of room to explore new technologies, but the core of the tech is our React Native app. I am currently transitioning out of this role, so if you know anyone that might fit, please send them [this link](https://jobb.babyjourney.se/jobs/2215547-chief-technology-officer).

Nextjs is also what I have used to build this website. Paired with Tailwindcss for an easier life.

As always, [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) things are on my mind. I think Firebase only really shines if you use all the bits and pieces in it. If you're only using it as a database, then you are probably better of using something like [Nhost](https://nhost.io/)
