This is a Now Page. If you don't know what a [Now Page](https://nownownow.com/about) is and you have your own website, I think you should one too.

## Life
I've been living in Stockholm since 2017 and, more specifically, SÃ¶dermalm since 2019. I've been living in startup land since 2012. Either working for startups, building startups or investing in startups. Usually all three at once.

To get my reading habit going in 2023, I've set a somewhat ambitious goal for myself to publish 24 blog posts this year. That's three times the number of blog posts I published in 2022 and so far I've published 2 posts:

* <Link href="/blog/youre_doing_fine">You're doing fine</Link>.
* <Link href="angel_investing_for_fun_and_profit">Angel Investing: For Fun and Profit(?)</Link>

I'm now also on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.nu/@qw4z1).

## Health and fitness

During December I gave myself permission to really let myself go. I properly gave in to my cravings and ate every tasty thing that came into my way. The only rule here was that after the Christmas weekend I promised myself to go on a fairly strict training program.

My current strength training routine consist of the classic [Starting Strength program](https://startingstrength.com/get-started/programs). My goal it to be able to squat 80 kg(3x5) paired with a body weight of 87 kg by the end of the year.

## Tech

Currently CTO at a startup called [Baby Journey](https://babyjourney.se/). Our vision is to become a universe for life with small children. This vision leaves a lot of room to explore new technologies, but the core of the tech is our React Native app. I am currently transitioning out of this role, so if you know anyone that might fit, please send them [this link](https://jobb.babyjourney.se/jobs/2215547-chief-technology-officer).

Nextjs is also what I have used to build this website. Paired with Tailwindcss for an easier life. Lately I've been going deep on [the T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/). I just feel so damn productive when using it for my side projects. This website will stay as vanilla Nextjs as possible though.
