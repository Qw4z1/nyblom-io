This is a Now Page. If you don't know what a [Now Page](https://nownownow.com/about) is and you have your own website, I think you should one too.

## Life
Traveling the world since 2023-06-17. Currently in Hanoi, Vietnam.

Unemployed and loving it. ðŸ¥° Not having a day job means I can more easily support any <Link href="/portfolio">portfolio company</Link> that might need my help.

To get my writing habit going in 2023, I've set a somewhat ambitious goal for myself to publish 24 blog posts this year. That's three times the number of blog posts I published last year.

## Health and fitness

Staying fit while traveling is a new challenge for me. I travel with my Adidas Power Perfect III so that if I have a gym close by I can get toss a barbell around. 

When I don't stay close to a gym I do a simple bodyweight routine in my hotel or room. This routine consist of:

Pushups, air squat, situps, one legged squats and inverted rows (if the table in my Airbnb is strong enough). 
 each and as many sets as I can. Although sometimes I get bored after 3 and just stop.

## Tech

Since I don't have a day job anymore, I'm free to explore whatever tech I want. My primary focus is currently Nextjs, where I'm working on a template project that I can use to bootstrap my many micro SaaS ideas. 

Nextjs is also what I have used to build this website. Paired with Tailwindcss for an easier life.

I no longer use [the T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/). This is partly because I want to work with the app directory, but also because I never really gelled with tRPC.
