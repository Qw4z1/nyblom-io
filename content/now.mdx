## Life

I've been back in Stockholm, Sweden since January 2024. My life now revolves around building mobile apps with my girlfriend, <Link href="/cto-coaching">coaching CTOs</Link>, and taking care of two foster cats.

Right now I am looking forward to two weeks in Portugal, where one will be spent at my favorite place in the world: [Boom Festival](https://www.boomfestival.org/)

Was recently a guest in two different podcasts. Always fun to talk about leadership, AI and coaching. If that sounds interesting to you, you can find them [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vnJlVbhYgM) and [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNzNMrVOfq8)

## Health and fitness

Loosing fat and gaining muscle. This year I think I've finally learned the value of pacing myself. Lost 5kg so far and getting stronger every week. I am making good progress with my pullups, much thanks to my [fitness coach](https://www.instagram.com/miltrain_foppa/). 

My strength goal for 2025 is to be able to do 10 pullups. I had more ambitious goals at the start of the year, but a herniated disk put an end to deadlifting and has made squatting heave tricky. Focusing on technique on squats the rest of the year feels like the smart thing to do right now.

As of August 2025 I'm at 5 pullups and 90 kg body weight (down from 98 in december 2024). My lift

## Tech

My primary technology focus is [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) and [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform/). 

I think Jetbrains really knocked it out of the park with this one. Every mobile app I build is therefore built with KMP and Compose. Every backend I build is built with Kotlin and Ktor (and/or Firebase).

Oh, and did I mention that I ❤️ Kotlin?
