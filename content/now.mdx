This is a Now Page. If you don't know what a [Now Page](https://nownownow.com/about) is and you have a personal website, I think you should have one too.

## Life

I've been back in Stockholm, Sweden since January 2024. My life now revolves around building mobile apps with my girlfriend, <Link href="/cto-coaching">coaching CTOs</Link>, and taking care of two foster cats.

Right now I am looking forward to two weeks in Portugal, where one will be spent at my favorite place in the world: [Boom Festival](https://www.boomfestival.org/)
<br/>
## Health and fitness

Loosing fat and gaining muscle. This year I think I've finally learned the value of pacing myself. Lost 5kg so far and getting stronger every week. I am making good progress with my pullups, much thanks to my [fitness coach](https://www.instagram.com/miltrain_foppa/). 

My strength goal for 2025 is to lift 300 kg in squats, bench and deadlifts combined, and to be able to do 10 pullups. 

~~That would have been very easy if it hadn't been for a herniated disc. =/ Haven't been able to squat heavy since before Christmas. ~~ 

My back feels great again! ü•≥ Restarting my squats again feels amazing!

## Tech

My primary technology focus is [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) and [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform/). 

I think Jetbrains really knocked it out of the park with this one. Every mobile app I build is therefore built with KMP and Compose. Every backend I build is built with Kotlin and Ktor (and/or Firebase).

Oh, and did I mention that I ‚ù§Ô∏è Kotlin?
