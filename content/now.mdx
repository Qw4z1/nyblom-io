## Life

Was traveling the world between 2023-06-17 and 2024-01-02. Now back in Stockholm, Sweden.

After over a decade of building apps, teams, and companies, I've now started coaching founders and CTOs through my <Link href="/nyblom-as-a-service/">Nyblom-as-a-Service</Link>.

If this is something that would be interesting to you feel free to schedule a <Link href={"https://cal.com/nyblomio/discovery-call"}>free discovery call</Link>!

Last year I published 12 blog posts, which was exactly half of my goal for the year. In 2024 I plan to publish another 12. One per month is a good pace for me to manage to maintain quality.

## Health and fitness

Back in Stockholm and back to my old routines! Getting strong using Stonglifts 5x5.

My two fitness goals for 2024 are 90 kg squat (5x5) by midsummer and 100 kg bench press by December 31.

## Tech

Since I don't have a day job anymore, I'm free to explore whatever tech I want. My primary focus is currently [Kotlin Multiplatform Compose](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/) and building mobile apps for iOS and Android using Kotlin.

I've also experimented a bit with [building a backend](https://github.com/Qw4z1/read-tracker) using Ktor and Kotlin. If I get the motivation I'll combine this backend with my companion mobile app to share models and business logic between iOS, Android, and Backend.

For my current project, though, I'm using Firebase. I just think Firebase gives the best bang for the buck when building mobile apps. Even compared to direct competitors, such as Supabase. This is because the client SDKs for Firebase are just so damn good.

Oh, and did I mention that I ❤️ Kotlin?
