## Life

I've been back in Stockholm, Sweden since January 2024. My life now revolves around coaching founders and senior leaders through my new company **<Link href="https://galantledarskap.se">Galant Ledarskap</Link>**. 

I'm also taking care of two cats. They used to be foster cats and where supposed to stay with us for 3-6 months. But nobody wanted to adopt two shy cats together, so... We decided to adopt them ourselves. 😇

A few months ago, I was invited on as a guest in two different podcasts. Always fun to talk about leadership, AI and coaching. If that sounds interesting to you, you can find them **[HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vnJlVbhYgM)** and **[HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNzNMrVOfq8)**.

## Health and fitness

Loosing fat and gaining muscle. This year I think I've finally learned the value of pacing myself. Lost 5kg so far and getting stronger every week. I am making good progress with my pullups, much thanks to my [fitness coach](https://www.instagram.com/miltrain_foppa/). 

My strength goal for 2025 is to be able to do 10 pullups. I had more ambitious goals at the start of the year, but a herniated disk put an end to deadlifting and has made squatting heave tricky. Focusing on technique on squats the rest of the year feels like the smart thing to do right now.

As of November 2025 I'm at 9 pullups and 87 kg body weight (down from 98 in december 2024). 💪

## Tech

My primary technology focus is to produce as little code as possible. Ideally zero. This is a consious decision made to be able to focus on supporting other leaders.

When I do code, it's all about [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) and [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform/). I ❤️ Kotlin?
