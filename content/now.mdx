## Life

I've been back in Stockholm, Sweden since January 2024. My life now revolves around building mobile apps with my girlfriend, <Link href="/nyblom-as-a-service/">coaching founders and leaders</Link>, and taking care of two foster cats.

Life is good!

## Health and fitness

I am currently in a weight loss phase. The goal is to drop to sub 90 kg and then just maintain my strength through the summer.

My strength goal for 2024 is to lift 300 kg in squats, bench and deadlifts combined. currently at 250 kg.

## Tech

My primary focus is currently [Kotlin Multiplatform Compose](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/). Every mobile app I build is built with KMP and Compose. 

I've also experimented a bit with [building a backend](https://github.com/Qw4z1/read-tracker) using Ktor and Kotlin. If I get the motivation I'll combine this backend with my companion mobile app to share models and business logic between iOS, Android, and Backend.

For my last two projects, I've been using Firebase. Firebase is great for a lot of things, but for my next project, I'm going all in on Kotlin. This means a Kotlin Multiplatform project with Android, iOS, and server (Ktor again) sharing code.

I'll still use parts of Firebase, though. Authentication and Cloud Messaging are just too good to pass on.

Everything will be hosted on Digital Ocean. If you are looking for a new provider for your apps, feel free to use my [referral link](https://m.do.co/c/52c509c9280e) to save us both some money. You get $200 in credits and I get $25. Pretty sweet, right?

Oh, and did I mention that I ❤️ Kotlin?
