    q: "What makes CTO coaching different from general executive coaching?",
    a: "CTO coaching combines traditional leadership development with hands-on technical and strategic mentoring from experienced CTOs. You'll benefit from both proven coaching methods and real-world insights from leaders who have faced similar challenges.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who is this coaching for?",
    a: "It's designed for CTOs, VPs of Engineering, and technical founders who want to grow as leaders, build stronger teams, and drive business results.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does the coaching process work?",
    a: "You'll start with a discovery call to clarify your goals. Then, you'll work with your coach in regular sessions to set objectives, identify obstacles, and develop actionable strategies for growth.",
  },
  {
    q: "What outcomes can I expect?",
    a: "Clients often report increased confidence, improved team performance, better decision-making, and greater job satisfaction. The process is tailored to your needs, so you get measurable, lasting results.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I include my team?",
    a: "Yes! Just coaching the CTO is the equivalent of building a silo. I regularly include team leads, directors and VP of Engineering in the coaching package. That way we get powerful team coaching in conjunction with the 1:1 coaching.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will I get any new tools?",
    a: "Absolutely! During our work I will help you implement the tools and frameworks that we agree are the best fit for your specific situation. Just remmeber that tools alone won't make you a great CTO, so the bulk of the work will be about creating shifts within you!",

    q: "How much does it cost?",
