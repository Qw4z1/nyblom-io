              <span role="img" aria-label="Leadership Confidence">ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</span> <strong>Leadership Confidence:</strong> One CTO I worked with was stepping into their first executive role and felt overwhelmed by the weight of decision-making. Through coaching, they developed a structured approach to setting priorities and communicating vision, which not only boosted their confidence but also inspired trust across their leadership team.

              <span role="img" aria-label="Team Performance">ü§ù</span> <strong>Team Performance:</strong> Another client faced persistent delivery bottlenecks and low morale within their engineering team.
