    q: "What makes CTO coaching different from general executive coaching?",
    a: "CTO coaching combines traditional leadership development with hands-on technical and strategic mentoring from experienced CTOs. You'll benefit from both proven coaching methods and real-world insights from leaders who have faced similar challenges.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who is this coaching for?",
    a: "It's designed for CTOs, VPs of Engineering, and technical founders who want to grow as leaders, build stronger teams, and drive business results.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does the coaching process work?",
    a: "You'll start with a discovery call to clarify your goals. Then, you'll work with your coach in regular sessions to set objectives, identify obstacles, and develop actionable strategies for growth.",
  },
  {
    q: "What outcomes can I expect?",
    a: "Clients often report increased confidence, improved team performance, better decision-making, and greater job satisfaction. The process is tailored to your needs, so you get measurable, lasting results.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I include my team?",
    a: "Yes! Just coaching the CTO is the equivalent of building a silo. I regularly include team leads, directors and VP of Engineering in the coaching package. That way we get powerful team coaching in conjunction with the 1:1 coaching.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will I get any new tools?",
    a: "Absolutely! During our work I will help you implement the tools and frameworks that we agree are the best fit for your specific situation. Just remmeber that tools alone won't make you a great CTO, so the bulk of the work will be about creating shifts within you!",

            <div>
              <span role="img" aria-label="Leadership Confidence">ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</span> <strong>Leadership Confidence:</strong> CTOs stepping into their first executive role can feel overwhelmed by the weight of decision-making. Coaching can help developing a structured approach to setting priorities and communicating vision, which not only boosted their confidence but also inspired trust across their leadership team.

            <div>
              <span role="img" aria-label="Team Performance">ü§ù</span> <strong>Team Performance:</strong> By addressing team dynamics and implementing new feedback practices, CTOs can overcome persistent delivery bottlenecks and low morale within their engineering teams. This leads to a measurable improvement in collaboration and output, transforming struggling teams into high-performing units.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">The Three Core Pillars of CTO Transformation</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">While each coaching engagement is tailored to your unique context, lasting change for CTOs consistently comes from strengthening three core areas. Here's how we'll work together to unlock your full leadership potential:</p>
          <div className="space-y-6 text-base text-gray-800">
            <div>
              <strong>Energy Management</strong> 
              <span className="block mt-1">Energy is your most valuable resource as a leader. Through coaching, you'll learn how to set boundaries, prioritize high-impact work, and create sustainable routines. This means less firefighting and more time for strategic thinking, so you can lead with clarity and avoid burnout‚Äîeven in high-growth, high-pressure environments.</span>
            </div>
            <div>
              <strong>Technical Excellence</strong>
              <span className="block mt-1">Technical excellence is about more than just code quality‚Äîit's about building a culture of continuous improvement, clear processes, and shared ownership. Together, we'll identify bottlenecks, level up your team, and align technology with business goals. The result: a tech org that delivers reliably, scales with your ambitions, and becomes a true growth driver for your company.</span>
            </div>
            <div>
              <strong>Executive Mindset</strong> 
              <span className="block mt-1">As CTO, your impact extends far beyond the engineering team. Coaching helps you develop the executive presence and strategic mindset needed to influence at the highest level. You'll learn to communicate your vision, build trust with the C-suite, and shift from being a technical problem-solver to a business leader who shapes the company's future.</span>
